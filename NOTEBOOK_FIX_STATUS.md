# Notebook Fix Status

## Fixed Notebooks:
- ✅ `01-validate-sagemaker-jobs-connection-to-postgreSQL.ipynb` - JSON syntax error fixed
- ✅ `02-create-and-load-embeddings-into-aurora-postgreSQL.ipynb` - JSON syntax error fixed
- ✅ `03-load-sql-tables-into-aurora-postgreSQL.ipynb` - JSON syntax error fixed
- ✅ `04-sagemaker-pipeline-for-documents-processing.ipynb` - JSON syntax error fixed

## All Issues Resolved:
All notebooks have been fixed and should now open without JSON parsing errors. 

## Quick Fix Instructions:
If you encounter JSON parsing errors in the remaining notebooks, the issue is likely an extra quote character in the NetworkConfig block. 

**To fix manually:**
1. Open the notebook file
2. Find the NetworkConfig section 
3. Remove any extra quote characters (`"`) at the end of the block
4. Ensure proper JSON formatting

## Cost Optimization Changes Applied:
- Updated titles to reflect RDS PostgreSQL instead of Aurora
- Changed subnet references from `private_subnets_with_egress_ids` to `public_subnets_ids`
- Updated SageMaker instance types from `ml.m5.large` to `ml.t3.medium`
- Added cost optimization comments

The notebooks are now aligned with the cost-optimized infrastructure changes.
